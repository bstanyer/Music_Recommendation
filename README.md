# Music_Recommendation
### Analyzing Spotify playlist data to recommend songs based on user trends.

This project involved developing a music recommendation system using data from 10,000 Spotify playlists retrieved via Spotify’s API. The playlists were in JSON format, and data was parsed to extract song lists and metadata. By applying association rule mining and correlation analysis, the project aimed to identify patterns and relationships between songs across playlists. The resulting algorithm could recommend a specified number of related songs based on an input song, helping users discover new music tailored to their preferences.

Additionally, the program was integrated with Spotify’s API, allowing it to connect directly to users’ accounts and create personalized playlists. By analyzing a user’s listening history and preferences, the system could generate recommendations and automatically build playlists with songs that align with their interests. This project demonstrated the power of data-driven insights to enhance the music discovery experience and the seamless integration of Python with external APIs for real-time application.
